[{"title":"How I Got Good at Coding Interviews","text":"hey guys it's me again and today i want\nto talk a little about how\ni got good at my coding interviews when\ni was preparing for them\nand how you can prepare for yours as\nwell and\ni know a lot of people on this channel\nprobably think that i'm a genius\nfrom the solution videos but i'm going\nto show you i'm not a genius\nand you really don't have to be a genius\neither now of course we all know that\ncoding interviews today center a lot on\nalgorithms so i'm going to be talking\nsomewhat about that but there's also\nsome clever stuff you can do\nto prepare what i like to call cheat\ncodes\nand i'll touch upon that as well first\nlet me give you a quick\nhistory lesson about a list of 75 leak\ncode questions\nso there was a facebook tech lead a\ncouple years ago\nwho compiled this 75 list of questions\nfrom apparently a couple hundred or\nsomething that they were looking at\nand they found that these 75 questions\nwere the most helpful\nthey were the most comprehensive they\ncovered","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVvr3ZjtjI8&t=0s"},{"title":"How I Got Good at Coding Interviews","text":"the most amount of patterns that you\nneeded to know\nfor a coding interview and this list\nhas become very infamous in the software\nengineering community and on online\nforums\nlike if you go on reddit and you know\nyou'll see this list mentioned a lot\nlike you'll see it mentioned in reddit\nyou'll see it mentioned\non blind a lot you'll see it mentioned\nwhen people ask about\nwhich problems should i study and even\nthis list of 170 questions that i posted\nin a previous video is actually\nbased upon this blind post\na lot of things have been created from\nthis one post\nif you go on leap code there's a\ndedicated list to these 75\nquestions and over 12 000 people have\nviewed it so you know that there's\nsomething good about these problems\nso that sounds easy enough right 75\nquestions\nthat's it these are really good problems\nthey have everything you need\njust solve all of them right so of\ncourse\nit's not that easy right some of these\nproblems are\nextremely difficult word search 2","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVvr3ZjtjI8&t=65s"},{"title":"How I Got Good at Coding Interviews","text":"is just one example try solving this\nproblem on your first\ntry in 30 minutes without having seen\nthe solution before\nvery few people can i like to call this\na crackhead problem because if you can\nsolve this problem in 30 minutes\nin an interview while explaining your\nsolution\ncreating a bug-free solution without\nhaving seen this problem before\nyou must be doing some crack or\nsomething else\nto be doing that there's just no way\nthat you could do that\nso that's the problem right there's only\n75 questions but some of them are\nextremely difficult\nso then the next thing people do they go\nto the discuss section\nthis person is really smart they made a\nreally good post about it\nthey tell you all these little details\nabout it right now you can\ntake a look at this and try to learn\nfrom it right but some people are just\ngoing to go straight to the code\ntry to memorize every semicolon every\nlittle detail about the problem\nthere's just no way you can do that at\nleast i wasn't able to so i took a","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVvr3ZjtjI8&t=130s"},{"title":"How I Got Good at Coding Interviews","text":"slightly different approach\ni did solve these 75 questions\ni did not try to memorize every line of\ncode in every detail\nthis is the workaround that i found\ninstead of memorizing\ncode how about i memorize the patterns\nright so to sum\nyou use a hash map you keep track of an\nindex something like that right\nno code this is english right and i\ndidn't even write\nthat much i just wrote one or two\nsentences\nfor word search two you can take a look\nat some of the notes that i wrote i\ndon't think it'll be helpful for you\nit's probably not even helpful for me\nbecause i don't even remember what i\nwrote so and i'm sure you guys probably\nhave similar experiences when you go\nback to review some of your notes\nbut that's like the idea right don't\nmemorize\n30 lines of code you know where if you\nforget a single semicolon you're screwed\ntry memorizing one or two sentences one\nor two patterns\nyou know for word search two\nyou can see that i i said oh there's\nthere's a little trick to this problem","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVvr3ZjtjI8&t=192s"},{"title":"How I Got Good at Coding Interviews","text":"there's a really clever trick that you\ncan just memorize\nand you can see that i did similar\nthings as well\nas i mentioned in previous videos right\ngrouping\nsimilar problems together array\nquestions together\ndynamic programming questions together\nyou'll notice\nthat dynamic probing programming\nquestions\nuse a lot of the same patterns a lot of\nthe same algorithms\nyou know go to tree questions they're\nactually not as different as you think\nlook at this recursive depth first\nsearch recursive first search recursive\ndepth first search\nright that's what i mean by hey some of\nthese problems are actually\nreally similar to each other now the\nlast thing i'm going to show you\nif all else fails go to leak code\ndiscuss section and go to the interview\nsection the interview questions section\nand\nsupposedly people share which interviews\nlike what interview questions they got\nat which company somebody posted\nwhat they got in a walmart online\nassessment\nuh don't tell anybody i sent you here","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVvr3ZjtjI8&t=255s"},{"title":"How I Got Good at Coding Interviews","text":"and i can't really confirm\nhow accurate these are because it is\nuser generated like\nand of course some of it might be\noutdated like you can see this is 2019\n2019 but you know\nit's at least a resource that i think a\nlot of people don't know about\nat the very least you might know that\nhey\nmaybe this company focuses on\ncertain data structures like if you go\nhere\nmicrosoft online assessment like this is\nthe long list of\nquestions so it might not even be\nhelpful for you because if there's like\nyou know like if there's a thousand\nquestions that they ask knowing\nthat list might not be helpful but it's\nat the very least a resource that i\nthink\nyou might not have known about so those\nare the main things that i want to talk\nabout unless i'm forgetting something\nbut if this was helpful please like and\nsubscribe\nthanks for watching leave any feedback\nthat you'd want i might make more like\nleak code solution\nvideos i might focus on other things i'm\nnot really sure right now\nwho knows um and\nyeah thanks for watching","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVvr3ZjtjI8&t=319s"}]
