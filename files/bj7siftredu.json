multiplying\nmatrices based on a centuries\nold algorithm.\nIt goes like this.\nMultiply elements from the\nfirst row of matrix A\nand the first column of matrix B\nand add them to get the first element of matrix C.\nThen repeat for the first row of matrix A\nand the second column of matrix B, and\nadd them for the second element in matrix C.\nAnd so on.\nMultiplying two two\nby two matrices this way,\ntakes eight multiplication steps.\nMultiplying any two N by N matrices with the standard\nalgorithm takes N-cubed steps.\nWhich is why applying this\nmethod to pairs of larger\nmatrices quickly becomes\nunwieldy.\nIf you take a matrix that is\ntwice as big, then you have to\nhave a computation time that is\neight times more.\nSo you can imagine, if you doubled it a\ncouple of times,

Algorithm","text":"reach the limits of what a\ncomputer can do.\nEnter Volker Strassen,\na German mathematician known for his\nwork analyzing algorithms.\nIn 1969, he discovered a new algorithm to multiply two by two matrices\nthat requires only seven multiplication steps.\nGoing from eight down to seven multiplications\nmay seem trivial,\nand the new addition steps look more complicated.\nBut Strassen's algorithm offers dramatic\ncomputational savings for larger matrices.\nThat's because when multiplying large\nmatrices, they can be broken down into smaller ones.\nFor example, an eight by eight\nmatrix can reduce to a series of\nnested two by two matrices.\nSo Strassen's savings applied to these smaller matrix\nmultiplications propagate over and over.\nApplying Strassen's to an eight by eight matrix results\nin a third fewer multiplication\nsteps compared to the standard  algorithm.\nFor very large matrices, these savings vastly\noutweigh the computation costs of the extra additions.","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDAPJ7rvcUw&t=123s"},{"title":"How AI Discovered a Faster Matrix Multiplication Algorithm","text":"A year after Strassen invented his algorithm, \nIBM researcher Shmuel Winograd\nproved it was impossible to use six or fewer multiplications\nto multiply two by two matrices,\nthus also proving that Strassens, with its\nseven multiplications is the best solution.\nFor half a century the most\nefficient method known for\nmultiplying two matrices of any\nreasonable size was to break\nthem down and apply Strassen's algorithm.\nThat was until October 2022, a new algorithm\nwas revealed that beat\nStrassen's, specifically for multiplying two four by four  matrices\nwhere the elements are\nonly zero or one.\nThis new algorithm made it possible to\nmultiply large matrices even faster\nby breaking them into four by four matrices \ninstead of two by two's.\nSo who or what was behind This\nbreakthrough?\nThis new algorithm was\ndiscovered by Google's\nartificial intelligence research\nlab, DeepMind.\nFor more than a decade, DeepMind has garnered\nattention for training AI

shattered the limited notion of what's possible for computers to achieve.\nDeepMind then set its sights on a problem even more challenging than Go.\nI was like very surprised that\neven for very small cases, we\ndon't even know what's the optimal \nway of doing matrix multiplication.\nAnd at some point, we realized\nthat this is actually a very good fit for machine learning techniques\nTo tackle matrix multiplication.\nDeepMind started with an\nalgorithm descended from AlphaGo\ncalled AlphaTensor.\nAlphaTensor is built on a\nreinforcement learning algorithm\ncalled AlphaZero.\nSo what one

theorem states, you only need four\ncolors to fill in any map so no\nneighboring regions match.\nThe pair verified their proof by processing all 1936 required\ncases\nrequiring more than 1000  hours

technique called\nreinforcement learning, which is kind of like\nplaying a game.\nReinforcement Learning strategically penalizes\nand rewards an AI system as it\nexperiments with different ways\nto

comes into play.\nA tensor is just an array of\nnumbers with any number of  dimensions.\nVectors are 1D tensors, and matrices are 2D tensors.\nThe process of multiplying any two matrices of a given size\ncan be described by a single unique 3D tensor.\nFor example, when multiplying any two, two by two matrices,\nwe can build the corresponding 3D tensor.\nEach dimension of this cube represents one of the matrices,\neach element in the cube can be one zero or negative one.\nThe matrix product C is created by combining elements\nfrom matrices A and B, like this.\nAnd so on.\nUntil you have the full matrix\nmultiplication tensor.\nNow, you can use a process\ncalled tensor decomposition to\nbreak down this 3D tensor into\nbuilding blocks.\nSimilar to taking apart a cube puzzle.\nOne natural way to break tensors down is into what's called\nrank-1 tensors,\nwhich are just products of vectors.\nThe trick is each rank-1 tensor here describes a multiplication

first element in the product C1.\nHere are the next two rank-1\ntensors, representing the\nmultiplications, A1 times B2 and\nA2 times B4, which form C2.\nEventually, the entire standard\nalgorithm with its eight\nmultiplication steps is\nrepresented by decomposing the\n3D tensor into eight rank-1 tensors.\nThese all add back up into the original 3D tensor.\nBut it's possible to decompose a\n3D tensor in different ways.\nStrassen's seven multiplication\nsteps for the same two by two\nmatrix multiplication looks like this.\nThese rank-1 tensors are more complex.\nAnd this is still a full decomposition, but in fewer steps,\nwhich add backup to the original tensor.\nSo the fewer rank-1 tensors, you use to\nfully decompose a 3D
